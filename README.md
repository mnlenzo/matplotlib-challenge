# **Pymaceuticals: Drug Efficacy Study — Capomulin vs. Other SCC Treatments**

## **Executive Summary**

Pymaceuticals recently completed a 45-day preclinical study evaluating the effectiveness of **Capomulin**, our drug of interest, against several existing and experimental treatments for **squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)**.

The study observed **249 mice**, each receiving one of ten drug regimens. Tumor sizes were measured repeatedly to assess treatment effectiveness.

**Key takeaway:**
➡️ **Capomulin demonstrated strong, consistent tumor reduction relative to most other treatments**, indicating it is a promising candidate for continued development.
➡️ Only one other regimen, **Ramicane**, showed similar performance levels.
➡️ Several regimens—notably **Ketapril**—underperformed and showed higher average tumor volumes.

# **Study Goals**

1. Evaluate Capomulin’s tumor-reduction performance.
2. Compare Capomulin against nine alternative drug regimens.
3. Identify patterns in tumor progression, mouse weight, and drug response.
4. Provide a statistical backbone for Pymaceuticals’ go/no-go decisions for future drug trials.

# **Key Findings**

## **1. Capomulin and Ramicane were the top-performing treatments.**

These two regimens consistently produced the **lowest final tumor volumes**, outperforming the other eight regimens.

* Mice treated with Capomulin showed **steady, controlled tumor shrinkage** across the study period.
* Tumor progression curves were notably **more stable** and **less volatile** compared to competing drugs.

## **2. Underperforming regimens showed larger tumors and more variability.**

* **Ketapril** and **Naftisol** had the **highest average tumor volumes**, indicating weak therapeutic effect.
* These regimens also showed **inconsistent responses**, suggesting poor reliability.

## **3. Capomulin demonstrated a measurable relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume.**

Heavier mice tended to have slightly larger tumor volumes while on Capomulin, showing a modest but meaningful correlation.
This may help optimize dosage strategies in future studies.

## **4. Capomulin achieved statistically significant tumor reduction.**

A linear regression analysis confirmed that **time on Capomulin** was strongly associated with **decrease in tumor size** (negative slope & strong R² value).

# **Methodology**

To ensure the clinical findings were reliable, we conducted:

### **Data Quality Checks**

* Removed duplicate mice
* Verified consistent tumor measurement intervals
* Merged metadata with study observations

### **Comparative Analysis**

* Calculated mean, median, variance, and SEM of tumor volumes
* Compared distributions across all drug regimens
* Examined outliers to assess data integrity

### **Visualization & Modeling**

Created charts and statistics to highlight trends:

* Tumor growth curves
* Final tumor volume bar charts
* Box plots to compare regimens
* Scatter and regression analysis for Capomulin performance

# **Insights for the Executive Team**

### **Capomulin Is Strong Enough to Advance to the Next Phase of Development**

Its consistent performance and tumor-shrinkage patterns align with what we want to see in a lead asset.

### **Ramicane Should Be Considered as a Secondary Benchmark**

Although strong, Ramicane’s mechanism of action differs enough to warrant separate consideration.

### **Several Regimens Can Be Deprecated**

Based on performance, variability, and lack of measurable tumor reduction:

* Ketapril
* Naftisol
* Stelasyn

These candidates do not warrant further investment unless re-formulated.

---

# **Recommendations for Leadership & R&D Teams**

### **1. Advance Capomulin into expanded trials.**

Its safety profile and tumor-reduction performance justify progression toward controlled human testing.

### **2. Investigate dosage optimization strategies.**

The weight-to-tumor relationship in Capomulin suggests potential for **precision dosing**.

### **3. Conduct mechanism-of-action comparison between Capomulin and Ramicane.**

Understanding *why* these two regimens perform well will inform future drug pipeline development.

### **4. Explore combination therapy pathways.**

Capomulin may be effective in combination with immunotherapies or targeted agents.

### **5. Deep-dive into non-responding tumor types.**

Certain mice showed irregular responses even under Capomulin.
Understanding these outliers could help identify:

* Resistance pathways
* Genetic predictors
* Whether SCC subtypes respond differently
